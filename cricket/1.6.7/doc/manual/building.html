    <h1>Building with Cricket Audio</h1>
    <a name="arm_instruction_sets"></a>
    <h2>ARM instruction sets</h2>
    All iOS devices, and most Android devices, run on processors that use some
    variant of the ARM instruction set, such as armv5TE, armv6, or armv7.&nbsp;
    Devices that support the armv7 instruction can support specialized
    instructions (called NEON instructions) that can significantly speed up
    audio processing.<br>
    <h3>iOS</h3>
    Most recent iOS devices currently use the armv7, armv7s, or arm64
    instruction set.&nbsp; The Cricket Audio library for iOS contains code for
    all three instruction sets plus the x86_64 code for the iPhone simulator,
    packed into a single library (a "fat binary").&nbsp; When you link your app
    to the Cricket Audio library, the linker will automatically choose the
    correct version.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Older iOS devices, prior to the iPhone 4 and 3rd generation iPod Touch, used
    the armv6 instruction set; however, Cricket Audio no longer supports armv6,
    because Xcode no longer generates armv6 code.<br>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    Android native code can be built for armv5 (referred to as "armeabi"), armv7
    ("armeabi-v7a"), or armv8 ("arm64-v8a").&nbsp; Code built for armv5 can run
    on all devices, but armv7 and armv8 code will run faster on processors that
    support those architectures.&nbsp; Typically you want to provide all
    versions in your .apk; at runtime, the operating system will load the
    library with the appropriate architecture.<br>
    <br>
    If you are using the Android Java interface (the Android SDK), you will just
    need to install all versions of the native Cricket Audio library (<span class="filename">libckjava.so</span>)
    with your app. (See <a href="#building_for_android_sdk">Building for the
      Android SDK</a> below.)<br>
    <br>
    If you are using the Android native interface (the Android NDK), you will
    want to build your native code for all instruction sets, linking each
    version to the appropriate version of the Cricket Audio library.&nbsp; By
    default, native code built for Android targets only the armv5 instruction
    set; while this will work, your code will not run as quickly as it could on
    armv7 or armv8 devices.&nbsp; To build for both instruction sets, you need
    to specify them in the&nbsp;<span class="filename">APP_ABI</span> variable
    in your&nbsp;<span class="filename">Application.mk</span> file.&nbsp; (See <a
      href="#building_for_android_ndk">Building for the Android NDK</a> below.)<br>
    <br>
    Some Android devices use Intel processors instead of ARM; to support those
    devices, you can build for the x86 and x86_64 architectures.&nbsp; Building
    for x86 and x86_64 also allows you to take advantage of Intel HAXM
    acceleration when running on the Android emulator.<br>
    <br>
    Cricket Audio does not support MIPS builds of Android; if you are targeting
    this architecture, please contact Cricket Audio support for more
    information.<br>
    <br>

    <a name="building_for_ios_or_osx"></a>
    <h2>Building for iOS, tvOS, or OS X</h2>
    Select your project in the Project Navigator.&nbsp; In the Project Editor,
    select the Build Settings tab.<br>
    <br>
    In the "Search Paths" section, add the path to the Cricket Audio <span class="filename">inc</span>
    directory to the "Header Search Paths" setting.&nbsp; (For example, if the
    Cricket Audio distribution is in&nbsp;<span class="filename">../../cricket</span>,
    the header search path would be <span class="filename">../../cricket/inc</span>.)<br>
    <br>
    In the "Search Paths" section, add the path to the Cricket&nbsp;<span class="filename">lib</span>
    directory to the "Library Search Paths" setting.&nbsp; To specify the
    configuration (debug or release), you can use the<span class="filename"></span>
    <span class="filename">${CONFIGURATION}</span> variable.&nbsp; (For example,
    if the Cricket Audio distribution is in&nbsp;<span class="filename">../../cricket</span>,
    the library search path for iOS would be <span class="filename">../../cricket/lib/ios/${CONFIGURATION}</span>.)<br>
    <br>
    In the "Linking" section, add&nbsp;<span class="filename">-lck</span> to the
    "Other Linker Flags" setting.&nbsp; If you are using the Objective-C
    interface, and you have no C++ code in your project, you may also need to
    add&nbsp;<span class="filename">-lstdc++</span> also.<br>
    <br>
    You will also probably want to make sure that any data files (bank files or
    stream files) are added to the project and set to be added as resources to
    your application bundle.<br>
    <br>
    If you are not already doing so, you will need to link to the AudioUnit,
    AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, CoreMedia, and MediaPlayer frameworks.<br>
    <br>
    For an example using Objective-C, take a look at the <a href="examples.html">hellocricket</a>
    sample, in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket/ios-objc</span>.&nbsp;
(There
    is an analogous OS X project in&nbsp;<span class="filename">osx-objc</span>.)&nbsp;
This
    app was generated from the Xcode template for a window-based iOS app, with
    just a few minor changes to play a sound using Cricket Audio.&nbsp; A "Run
    Script" build phase was added to the target, which uses the&nbsp;<a href="cktool.html"><span
        class="filename">cktool</span></a> utility to build the binary bank file
    from the bank description file.&nbsp; Finally, the binary bank file&nbsp;<span
      class="filename">hellocricket.ckb</span> was added to the project, which
    automatically added it to the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.<br>
    <br>
    For an example using C++, take a look at the <a href="examples.html">hellocricket</a>
    sample, in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket/ios-cpp</span>.&nbsp;
(There
    is an analogous OS X project in&nbsp;<span class="filename">osx-cpp</span>.)
    This app is identical to the Objective-C version, except the app delegate
    class uses the C++ Cricket Audio interface instead of Objective-C.&nbsp; The
    file containing the app delegate class,&nbsp;<span class="filename">hellocricketAppDelegate.mm</span>,
    was renamed from&nbsp;<span class="filename">hellocricketAppDelegate.m</span>,
    so the Objective-C++ compiler, rather than the Objective-C compiler, would
    be used to build it.&nbsp; (Alternatively, we could have changed the type of
    the source file from "Objective-C source" to "Objective-C++ source" in the
    File Inspector.)<br>
    <a name="building_for_android_sdk"></a>
    <h2>Building for the Android SDK with Android Studio</h2>
    Cricket Audio for the Android SDK consists of a .aar file (<span class="filename">ck.aar</span>)
    which contains both the Java interface and the native code. <br>
    <br>
    For an example, look at the <a href="examples.html">hellocricket</a>
    sample, in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket/android-sdk</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In
    particular, look at <span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket/android-sdk/app/build.gradle</span>
    for an example of how to specify the path to the ck.aar file.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="building_for_android_ndk"></a>
    <h2>Building for the Android NDK </h2>
    <p>Cricket Audio for the Android NDK consists of static libraries and
      headers. </p>
    <p> For an example, look at the NDK <a href="examples.html">hellocricket</a>
      sample, at&nbsp; <span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket/android-ndk.</span>
      This example uses a Java activity class that calls the native Cricket
      Audio code using a JNI call; there is a similar example in <span class="filename">android-ndk-native</span>
      that uses a native activity instead.&nbsp; </p>
    <br>
    <a name="building_for_windows"></a>
    <h2>Building for Windows</h2>
    Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer, and choose Properties.<br>
    <br>
    Under C++ » General » Additional Include Directories, add the path to the
    Cricket Audio <span class="filename">inc</span> directory.&nbsp; (For
    example, if the Cricket Audio distribution is in&nbsp;<span class="filename">../../cricket</span>,
    the header search path would be <span class="filename">../../cricket/inc</span>.)<br>
    <br>
    Under Linker » General » Additional Library Directories, add the path to the
    appropriate Cricket Audio library directory.&nbsp; The correct path relative
    to the Cricket Audio distribution is:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;" class="filename">lib/win/<span style="font-style: italic;">VisualStudioVersion</span>/<span
        style="font-style: italic;">Platform</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">Configuration</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    where<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;" class="filename">VisualStudioVersion</span>
      is one of:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="filename">vs12.0</span> (Visual Studio 2013)</li>
        <li><span class="filename">vs14.0</span> (Visual Studio 2015)<span class="filename"></span></li>
        <li><span class="filename">vs15.0</span> (Visual Studio 2017)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-style: italic;" class="filename">Platform</span> is one
      of:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="filename">x86</span></li>
        <li><span class="filename">x64</span></li>
      </ul>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;" class="filename">Configuration</span>
      is one of:<br>
      <ul>
        <li class="filename">DebugStatic</li>
        <li class="filename">DebugDynamic</li>
        <li class="filename">ReleaseStatic</li>
        <li class="filename"> ReleaseDynamic</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    If your program is linking to the Microsoft runtime statically (i.e. is
    compiled with <span class="filename">/MT</span> or <span class="filename">/MTd</span>),
    then use one of the "Static" configurations; if it is linking to the
    Microsoft runtime dynamically (i.e. is compiled with <span class="filename">/MD</span>
    or <span class="filename">/MDd</span>), then use one of the "Dynamic"
    configurations.<br>
    <br>
    On Windows 8.0 and later, Cricket Audio will use XAudio2 2.8, which comes
    preinstalled with Windows.&nbsp; In earlier versions of Windows, it will use
    XAudio2 2.7; the DirectX runtime may need to be installed separately on the
    target system.<br>
    <br>
    If your program is a Windows Store app (formerly called a Metro app), you
    must use either the <span class="filename">DebugDynamic</span> or <span class="filename">ReleaseDynamic</span>
    library.<br>
    <br>
    You can use the Visual Studio macros&nbsp;<span class="filename">$(Configuration)</span>,&nbsp;<span
      class="filename">$(VisualStudioVersion)</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="filename">$(PlatformShortName)</span>
    to specify the correct path for your program.&nbsp; For example, if the
    Cricket Audio distribution is in&nbsp;<span class="filename">../../cricket</span>,
    and you are linking statically to the runtime, the library search path would
    be <span class="filename">../../cricket/lib/vs$(VisualStudioVersion)/$(PlatformShortName)/$(Configuration)Static</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Under Linker » Input » Additional Dependencies, add&nbsp;<span class="filename">ck.lib</span>
    to the list of libraries.<br>
    <h2><a id="building_for_linux" name="building_for_linux"></a>Building for
      Linux</h2>
    <p>Make sure you add the path to the Cricket Audio header files to the list
      of include directories, and the path to the Cricket Audio libraries to the
      list of library directories.&nbsp; In addition to the Cricket Audio
      library (<span class="filename">libck.a</span>), you will need to link to
      the ALSA shared library (<span class="filename">libasound.so</span>).&nbsp;
      </p>
    <p>For example, to build the 64-bit debug version of the hellocricket
      sample, the command line is:</p>
    <p class="filename">g++ hellocricket.cpp -o hellocricket -I../../../../inc
      -L../../../../lib/linux/x64/debug -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lck
      -lasound</p>
