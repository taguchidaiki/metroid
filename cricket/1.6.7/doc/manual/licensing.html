    <h1>Licensing</h1>
    Cricket Audio is available under two licenses: the free license, and the
    (non-free) source code license.<br>
    <h2> Free license</h2>
    This free license allows you to use the binary form of Cricket Audio for no
    cost, with a few requirements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Include the following message somewhere in your app, visible to users
        (for example, on a credits screen):<br>
        <br>
        <i>Built with Cricket Audio<br>
          www.crickettechnology.com</i><br>
        <br>
        You may optionally include our logo (in <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com/images/logo.svg">.svg</a>
        or <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com/images/logo_256.png">.png</a>
        format).<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Do not distribute our software to anyone, or post it for download on
        any site; refer them to <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com" target="_top">our
          website</a> instead.</li>
      <br>
      <li>This license does not permit you to distribute Cricket Audio in an
        SDK, library, or other software development product. Contact us at
        <script>nospam("info", "crickettechnology.com")</script> for additional
        licensing options.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If you release an app that uses Cricket Audio, you must let us know;
        we will include a link to it on our <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com/customers"
          target="_top">customers</a> page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Source code license</h2>
    The source code license allows you to use the binary form of Cricket Audio
    and provides access to the Cricket Audio source code.&nbsp; Unlike the free
    license, there is no requirement for a credit in the final product (though
    you can include one if you want), and you do not need to notify us of your
    releases (though you're free to do that too).<br>
    <br>
    The source code license also has a few requirements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not distribute our software to anyone, or post it for download on
        any site; refer them to <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com" target="_top">our
          website</a> instead.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Do not distribute the source code to anyone who does not have an
        active source code license.</li>
      <br>
      <li>This license does not permit you to distribute Cricket Audio in an
        SDK, library, or other software development product. Contact us at
        <script>nospam("info", "crickettechnology.com")</script> for additional
        licensing options.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Source code licenses can be purchased on our <a href="http://www.crickettechnology.com/source_license"
      target="_top">website</a>.<br>
