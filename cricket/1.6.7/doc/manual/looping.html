    <h1>Looping sounds</h1>
    <h2>Specifying loop parameters</h2>
    Some sounds are simply played from beginning to end; for example, a
    line of spoken dialog, a gunshot, or a footstep.&nbsp; For some other
    sounds, it is useful<br>
    &nbsp;to be able to play the sound in a loop.&nbsp; For example, in a
    car racing game, you might want the sound of the engine to play in a
    continuous loop while the car is in motion.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    You can simply loop a sound from the beginning to the end; you can also
    loop just a section of the sound.&nbsp; For example, for our car engine
    sound, sample frames 0-1000 might contain the sound of the engine
    starting up; sample frames 1000-2000 might contain the loop of the
    engine running; and sample frames 2000-3000 might contain the sound of
    the engine dying.&nbsp; If you set the loop start and end to 1000 and
    2000 and the loop count to -1, when you play the sound, you would first
    hear the sound of the car starting up, then the sound of the car
    running would loop continuously until you explicitly tell it to
    release, at which point you would hear the sound of the engine dying.<br>
    <br>
    There are a few ways to specify loop parameters for a sound: in the source
    audio file, as sound attributes in&nbsp;<span class="filename">cktool</span>,
    or at runtime using the API.<br>
    <h3>Specifying loop parameters in an audio file</h3>
    Both the WAV and AIFF file formats can store loop information; however,
    not all audio editors include loop information when they export WAV or
    AIFF files, so you may wish to test this with your editor of
    choice.&nbsp; (For example, Sony Sound Forge does export loop
    information; the free Audacity editor does not.)&nbsp; If&nbsp;<span class="filename">cktool</span>
    detects a loop in the source audio file when generating a bank sound or
    stream sound, it automatically sets the loop start, end, and count from
    the data in the audio file.<br>
    <br>
    If you audio editor does not support loops, but does support named
    regions, you can mark your loop as a region named "loop", and&nbsp;<span class="filename">cktool</span>
    will set the loop start and end based on the region.<br>
    <br>
    Loop settings from the audio file can be overridden by either sound
    attributes in cktool or by API calls at runtime.<br>
    <h3>Specifying loop parameters as sound attributes in&nbsp;<span class="filename">cktool</span></h3>
    You can also specify the loopStart, loopEnd, and loopCount sound attributes
    to&nbsp;<span class="filename">cktool</span> when creating bank sounds or
    stream sounds; see the&nbsp;<a href="cktool.html"><span class="filename">cktool</span>
      documentation</a>
    for more details on how to use these attributes.&nbsp; Sound attributes
    will override loop data in the source audio files, but can be
    overridden by API calls.<br>
    <h3>Specifying loop parameters at runtime</h3>
    Finally, you can specify loop parameters at runtime using the API; for
    example,&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSound::setLoop()</span>,&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSound::setLoopCount()</span>,
    and&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSound::releaseLoop()</span>.<br>
    <h2>Creating seamless loops</h2>
    Creating audio data that loops seamlessly, without pops or clicks at
    the loop point, is somewhat of an art.&nbsp; In general, you want to
    minimize the discontinuity between the last sample of the loop and the
    first sample of the loop.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Take a look at this simple example, using a simple sine wave:<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 556px; height: 146px;" alt="" src="images/loop1.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If we were to loop over this entire file, the discontinuity between the
    last and first samples would cause a noticeable click.&nbsp; The
    resulting waveform would look something like this:<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 1112px; height: 148px;" alt="" src="images/loop2.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A solution would be to trim the data off the end, so the audio data looks
    like this:<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 455px; height: 147px;" alt="" src="images/loop3.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Or, rather than loop from beginning to end, set the loop points to minimize
    the discontinuity, for example, at zero crossings:<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 556px; height: 146px;" alt="" src="images/loop4.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If your data is encoded as ADPCM, this is tricker, because the loop
    points must be at multiples of 36 samples, which is the ADPCM block
    size.<br>
