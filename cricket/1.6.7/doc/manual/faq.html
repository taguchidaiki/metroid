    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>How can I minimize CPU and battery usage?</h2>
    In general, try to reduce the amount of audio data being pushed through the
    system.&nbsp; Using mono instead of stereo, and lower sample rate source
    data, will decrease the amount of data that needs to be processed; this will
    lower your CPU usage, as well as decrease the size of your bank files, but
    there may be a loss of audio quality.<br>
    <br>
    Increasing the audio update interval (with <span class="filename">Config.audioUpdateMs</span>)
    to something greater than the default of 5ms will decrease CPU usage
    somewhat, but will increase latency (the amount of time between when you
    make an API call and when you hear the results of that call). <br>
    <br>
    Also, your choice of audio encoding is important.&nbsp; PCM16 and PCM8 are
    the most efficient; ADPCM is less efficient; and stream formats such as MP3,
    MP4, or Ogg Vorbis are the least efficient.&nbsp; (However, depending on
    your target platform, there may be hardware support for decoding some of
    these stream formats; see <a href="#hardware_support">this FAQ entry</a>.)<br>
    <h2><a id="stream_formats" name="stream_formats"></a>What audio format
      should I use for my streams?</h2>
    <p>This will depend, of course, on the requirements of your app, but in
      general, we recommend either .cks or .ogg streams.&nbsp; These formats are
      decoded in software by Cricket Audio, so they will work identically on all
      platforms and all devices, and do not require any licensing fees.</p>
    <p>Streams in the .ogg format are compressed much more than .cks streams, so
      they take up less storage space, but require significantly more CPU to
      decode.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2><a id="hardware_support" name="hardware_support"></a>Is there support
      for hardware acceleration of decoding?</h2>
    This depends on the particular audio encoding, and your platform.<br>
    <h3> iOS</h3>
    On iOS, at time of writing, there is hardware support for decoding streams
    in the following formats:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>AAC (MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding)</li>
      <li>ALAC (Apple Lossless)</li>
      <li>HE-AAC (MPEG-4 High-Efficiency AAC)</li>
      <li>MP3 (MPEG-1 audio layer 3)</li>
    </ul>
    For more information on the hardware decoders provided by iOS, see the iOS <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/LIBRARY/IOS/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html">Multimedia
      Programming Guide</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In Cricket Audio, hardware decoding support is only enabled if <span class="filename">CkConfig.enableHardwareDecoding</span>
    is true.&nbsp; Note that this is set to false by default, because streams
    that use the hardware decoder take slightly longer (about 300ms) to
    initialize, we have found the difference in CPU usage between hardware and
    software decoding as measured by Instruments to be negligible.<br>
    <br>
    Hardware support is limited to a single stream, and may not be available at
    all depending on the audio session category and whether the hardware decoder
    is in use by another app.&nbsp; If the hardware decoder is not available, a
    software decoder will be used.&nbsp; If the hardware decoder is available
    when a stream is created, that stream will keep ownership of the decoder
    until the stream is destroyed.<br>
    <h3> Android</h3>
    On Android, there are no guarantees about hardware support; it is entirely
    up to the device manufacturer.<br>
    <h2>Why can't I load my large bank file on Android?&nbsp; I get an error
      message about "UNCOMPRESS_DATA_MAX".<br>
    </h2>
    Android versions prior to 2.3 cannot read compressed assets with an
    uncompressed size greater than 1 MB.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get around this
    restriction, you can try to break up your bank file into multiple smaller
    banks with uncompressed size less than 1 MB, or you can disable compression
    for your bank.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To disable compression, if you are building your .apk manually using
    the&nbsp;<span class="filename">aapt</span> tool, you can use the&nbsp;<span
      class="filename">-0</span> flag (e.g. "<span class="filename">-0 ckb</span>"
    to disable compression for bank files with the&nbsp;<span class="filename">.ckb</span>
    file extension).&nbsp; However, if you are building your .apk automatically
    from Eclipse, there is currently no way to specify this flag; a workaround
    is to give your bank file a file extension for which&nbsp;<span class="filename">aapt</span>
    already disables compression, such as&nbsp;<span class="filename">.jpg</span>
    or&nbsp;<span class="filename">.wma</span>.<br>
    <br>
    See this <a href="http://ponystyle.com/blog/2010/03/26/dealing-with-asset-compression-in-android-apps/">link</a>
    for a more detailed description of this problem and its workarounds.&nbsp;
    Note that Android versions 2.3 and later do not have this restriction.<br>
    <h2>Why can't I set a pitch shift or apply effects to MP3 streams on
      Android?</h2>
    Whenever possible, we try to use the Android platform (using the OpenSL ES
    API) for decoding of audio, so we can take advantage of any hardware
    acceleration present on the device.&nbsp; While the Android platform
    provides a way to play compressed streams (e.g. MP3, etc), it does not
    provide a way to decompress them into memory.&nbsp; This means we cannot
    decompress the data using the Android platform, and then perform our own
    processing with them, so we are limited to using the features provided by
    Android itself for compressed streams.<br>
    <br>
    Cricket Audio can decode Ogg Vorbis audio files using a software decoder on
    all platforms, if&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkConfig.enableOggVorbis</span>
    is set to true (which is the default), so pitch adjustment and other
    processing can be done with those files.<br>
    <h2> Which iOS and Android versions do you support?</h2>
    On iOS, Cricket Audio is tested for versions 6.1 and later.<br>
    <br>
    On Android, Cricket Audio is tested for versions 2.2 and later.&nbsp; <br>
    <h2> How do I determine the URL for an item in the iTunes library for use
      with CkSound::newAssetStreamSound()?<br>
    </h2>
    Here's some sample code that will create a sound to play an item with a
    particular title in the iTunes library:<br>
    <code> #import &lt;MediaPlayer/MediaPlayer.h&gt;<br>
      <br>
      MPMediaQuery *query = [[MPMediaQuery alloc] init];<br>
      [query addFilterPredicate:[MPMediaPropertyPredicate
      predicateWithValue:@"Some Song Title"
      forProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyTitle]];<br>
      CkSound* sound = NULL;<br>
      if ([query.items count] &gt; 0)<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPMediaItem* item = [query.items objectAtIndex:0]; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSURL* assetUrl = [item
      valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyAssetURL];<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // assetUrl will be nil if track is protected with DRM<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (assetUrl)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound =
      CkSound::newAssetStreamSound([assetUrl.absoluteString UTF8String]);<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
      } </code> <br>

    <h2>I'm writing a music app for iOS, and am supporting remote control
      events.&nbsp; How do I make the play icon in the status bar disappear when
      I'm not playing music?</h2>
    If your app calls the <span class="filename">beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents</span>
    method on its <span class="filename">UIApplication</span> instance, the
    play icon will show up as long as Cricket Audio is active.<br>
    <br>
    After calling&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkInit()</span>, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSuspend()</span>.&nbsp;
This
    suspends Cricket Audio, causing iOS to hide the play icon in the status
    bar.&nbsp; When you start to play music, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkResume()</span>
    to show the icon; when the music stops, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkSuspend()</span>
    again to hide it.<br>

    <h2>Why are my banks/streams loading on the iPhone/iPad Simulator, but not
      on the device?</h2>
    File paths are case-sensitive on iOS devices, but not on the simulator; make
    sure your file paths have the correct case.<br>
    <h2>How can I stream audio that is in a proprietary or unsupported data
      format?</h2>
    First, create a subclass of&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkCustomStream</span>
    that decodes your data into 16-bit signed integer PCM audio data; then
    register a factory function that returns an instance of that class with <span
      class="filename">CkSound::setCustomStreamHandler()</span>.<br>
