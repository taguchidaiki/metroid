    <h1>Example code</h1>
    <h2>Hello Cricket</h2>
    The "hellocricket" example, in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/hellocricket</span>,
    is a very simple example that plays a single bank sound when it
    starts.&nbsp; There are several versions:<br>
    <br>
    Android:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>android-ndk: Uses the NDK and the C++ Cricket Audio interface in a
        Java activity.</li>
      <li>android-ndk-native: Uses the NDK and the C++ Cricket Audio interface
        in a native activity</li>
      <li>android-sdk: Uses the SDK and the Java Cricket Audio interface</li>
    </ul>
    iOS:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>ios-objc: Uses the Objective-C Cricket Audio interface</li>
      <li>ios-cpp: Uses the C++ Cricket Audio interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OS X:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>osx-objc: Uses the Objective-C Cricket Audio interface</li>
      <li>osx-cpp: Uses the C++ Cricket Audio interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Windows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>win: Uses the C++ Cricket Audio interface</li>
    </ul>
    Linux:
    <ul>
      <li>linux: Uses the C++ Cricket Audio interface</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Game</h2>
    The "game" example is a simple demonstration of how to use Cricket Audio
    with C++ to write cross-platform iOS and Android OpenGL apps.&nbsp; Most of
    the code, in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/game</span>, is
    cross-platform; the platform-specific code and data files are in the&nbsp;<span
      class="filename">android</span> and&nbsp;<span class="filename">ios</span>
    subdirectories.<br>
    <br>
    To build the game for iOS, use the Xcode project in&nbsp;<span class="filename">src/samples/game/ios</span>.<br>
    To build the game for Android, open the <span class="filename">src/samples/game/android</span>
    directory with Android Studio.
    <p>Navigate around by moving your finger on the screen; drag left or right
      to turn, and drag forward or back to move forward or backward.&nbsp; Try
      to poke the spinning cubes with the orange pointer.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="dsptouch" name="dsptouch"></a>DspTouch</h2>
    The "dsptouch" example is a simple app that demonstrates how to use DSP
    effects and how to share C++ code across platforms.&nbsp; The code that uses
    Cricket Audio is a cross-platform C++ file, <span class="filename">dsptouch.cpp</span>,
    which is used by each platform.<br>
    <br>
    Note that unlike the "game" example, this is not an OpenGL (or DirectX) app,
    so there is no explicit render loop.&nbsp; Instead, CkUpdate() is called
    from a timer callback on each platform, on the main thread.<br>
    <br>
    When the app starts, a sound starts looping.&nbsp; When you touch the
    screen, the effects are applied.&nbsp; Moving your finger along the X or Y
    axes adjusts one of two parameters.&nbsp; You can edit the code in <span class="filename">DspTouch.cpp</span>
    to change which sample is played, which effect is applied, and which effect
    parameters are modified.<br>
    <br>
    One of the effects is a custom "stutter" effect, defined in <span class="filename">stutterprocessor.cpp</span>,
    which provides a simple example of how to implement custom DSP effects.<br>
    <br>
    To build for iOS, use the Xcode project in <span class="filename">src/samples/dsptouch/ios</span>.<br>
    To build for Android, open the <span class="filename">src/samples/dsptouch/android</span>
    directory with Android Studio.<br>
