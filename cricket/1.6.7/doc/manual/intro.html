    <h1>Introduction to Cricket Audio</h1>
    <a name="the_cricket_audio_interface"></a>
    <h2>The Cricket Audio interface</h2>
    The basic Cricket Audio interface is C++, which means that cross-platform
    native code can be written for iOS, tvOS, OSX, Android, Windows, and
    Linux.&nbsp; However, each platform may also have alternative interfaces
    available; there is a Java interface for Android and an Objective-C
    interface for iOS/tvOS/OSX.<br>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    On Android, you may use either the C++ interface or the Java
    interface.&nbsp; If you are developing in Java with the SDK, you must use
    the Java interface; if you are developing with the NDK, you must use the C++
    interface. (Note that both interfaces are not designed to be used together
    in the same app; if you initialize Cricket Audio from Java, you should not
    use the C++ interface, and vice versa.)<br>
    <br>
    The names of the classes and methods in the Java interface are mostly the
    same as those in the C++ interface, except class names do not have the "Ck"
    prefix.&nbsp; All classes are in the <span class="filename">com.crickettechnology.audio</span>
    package.<br>
    <br>
    Since Java cannot pass method parameters by reference, the Java interface
    uses the&nbsp;<span class="filename">FloatRef</span> and&nbsp;<span class="filename">IntRef</span>
    classes to emulate reference parameters.&nbsp; For example, this C++ code:<br>
    <br>
    <code> int loopStart, loopEnd;<br>
      sound-&gt;getLoop(loopStart, loopEnd);<br>
    </code> <br>
    corresponds to this code in Java:<br>
    <br>
    <code> IntRef loopStartRef = new IntRef();<br>
      IntRef loopEndRef = new IntRef();<br>
      sound.getLoop(loopStartRef, loopEndRef);<br>
      int loopStart = loopStartRef.get();<br>
      int loopEnd = loopEndRef.get();<br>
    </code> <br>
    <h3>iOS/tvOS/OSX</h3>
    On iOS/tvOS/OSX, you may use either the C++ interface or the Objective-C
    interface.&nbsp; If you use the C++ interface, source files that use the
    Cricket Audio API should be either C++ files (<span class="filename">.cpp</span>)
    or Objective-C++ files (<span class="filename">.mm</span>).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The names of the classes and methods in the Objective-C interface are mostly
    the same as those in the C++ interface, except:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Class names are prefixed with "Cko" instead of "Ck".</li>
      <li>For simple getter functions, the "get" prefix has been removed, to
        follow Objective-C conventions; for example,&nbsp;<span class="filename">[mixer
          name]</span> instead of&nbsp;<span class="filename">[mixer getName]</span>.</li>
      <li>Where appropriate, properties have been defined for simple set/get
        functions, so the property syntax can be used: for example, <span class="filename">mixer.name
          </span>instead of&nbsp;<span class="filename">[mixer name]</span>.</li>
      <li>To create an object, use one of the class factory methods (such
        as&nbsp;<span class="filename">newMixer</span>,&nbsp;<span class="filename">newStreamSound</span>,&nbsp;<span
          class="filename">newBank</span>, etc), rather than calling&nbsp;<span
          class="filename">alloc</span> and&nbsp;<span class="filename">init</span>.&nbsp;
        As you would expect following the "NARC" conventions, the returned
        object has a retain count of 1.</li>
    </ul>
    The method names occasionally deviate from the Apple Objective-C naming
    conventions to make it clearer to which functions in the C++ interface they
    correspond.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a name="types_of_sounds"></a>
    <h2>Types of sounds</h2>
    There are two types of sounds in Cricket Audio: <span style="font-style: italic;">stream
      sounds</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">bank sounds</span>.&nbsp;
    Bank sounds are fully loaded into memory before they are played, while
    stream sounds read their data from the device's file storage (or from the
    network) as needed.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Bank sounds</h3>
    Bank sounds are created from a bank description file, which is created
    offline using the&nbsp;<a href="cktool.html"><span class="filename">cktool</span></a>
    utility.&nbsp; Each bank can contain one or more sounds.&nbsp; The bank must
    be loaded completely into memory before any sounds are created from
    it.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; a bank is loaded, bank sounds can be played instantly
    (unlike stream sounds, which must read data from storage before they can be
    played).&nbsp; Typically, bank sounds are used for short sound effects. <br>
    <br>
    Bank sounds can be stored in several data formats:<span class="todo"></span><br>
    <ul>
      <li>16-bit PCM: This is the default format.&nbsp; The data is
        uncompressed, so it requires very few CPU cycles to play, but uses 2
        bytes per sample per channel (about the same as a typical uncompressed
        .wav or .aiff file).</li>
      <li>8-bit PCM: Also uncompressed, but only uses 1 byte per sample per
        channel (half the space of 16-bit PCM), and lower audio quality.<br>
      </li>
      <li>ADPCM: A compressed format that requires somewhat more CPU cycles to
        play, but requires 1/3 of the space of 16-bit PCM.&nbsp; Audio quality
        is typically somewhat worse than 16-bit PCM but better than 8-bit
        PCM.&nbsp; Samples are packed in blocks of 36 samples (24 bytes).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The format for each sound is specified in the bank description file.&nbsp;
    Deciding which format to use for a particular sound requires making a
    tradeoff between CPU load, memory, and sound quality.&nbsp; (We recommend
    that you start with 16-bit PCM, and then switch some or all of your sounds
    to one of the other formats if necessary to reduce the size of your banks,
    paying attention to the changes in sound quality.)<br>
    <br>
    More information on how to create banks using cktool, and how to create a
    bank description file, is in the <a href="cktool.html">cktool</a> section.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Stream sounds</h3>
    Stream sounds are typically used for long sounds that are too large to fit
    in memory, such as music or ambient sounds; rather than having the entire
    sound in memory, the audio data is read from storage or the network as
    needed.&nbsp; While this can use less memory than placing a large sound in a
    bank, it does require file and network resources, and the sound is not ready
    immediately after it is created.<br>
    <br>
    The most portable formats for a stream sound are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>.ogg (Ogg Vorbis)<br>
      </li>
      <li>.cks<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    These formats are supported on all platforms, including Windows and OS X,
    and we recommend that you use them for most purposes.<br>
    <br>
    Files in the .cks format are created using <a href="cktool.html">cktool</a>;
    the audio data can be in the same formats supported by bank sounds (16-bit
    PCM, 8-bit PCM, or ADPCM).<br>
    <br>
    Streams can also be in other audio file formats; support for these varies by
    platform.&nbsp; Currently, the following additional formats are supported on
    both iOS and Android:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>.wav (uncompressed, or with µ-law or a-law compression)</li>
      <li>.mp3</li>
      <li>.mp4 (AAC compression)</li>
      <li>.m4a (AAC compression)</li>
    </ul>
    The iOS version can read the following additional audio file formats:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>.aac, .adts (AAC compression)</li>
      <li>.aiff, .aif, .aifc</li>
      <li>.caf</li>
      <li>.m4a (Apple Lossless compression)</li>
      <li>.snd, .au (uncompressed, or µ-law compression)</li>
      <li>.sd2</li>
    </ul>
    The Android version can read the following additional audio file formats:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>.amr</li>
    </ul>
    Android devices may be able to read additional audio file formats, such as
    FLAC, depending on the particular device and the version of Android on it.<br>
    <br>
    You may need to purchase a license from Technicolor to play .mp3 content in
    your app; see the <a target="_top" href="http://www.mp3licensing.com">mp3licensing.com</a>
    website for more information.<br>
    <br>
    Be aware that some of these formats (such as .mp3, .ogg, and .m4a) require
    significant CPU cycles to decode.&nbsp; The target device may have hardware
    acceleration for decoding of some formats, but typically this can only be
    used on one stream at a time; see the corresponding <a href="faq.html#hardware_support">FAQ
      entry</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="initializing"></a>
    <h2>Initializing</h2>
    Before making any other calls to the Cricket Audio library, you must
    initialize it.<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> #include &lt;ck/ck.h&gt;<br>
      #include &lt;ck/config.h&gt;<br>
      <br>
      // ...<br>
      // then, in your initialization code:<br>
      <br>
      #if CK_PLATFORM_ANDROID<br>
      CkConfig config(env, activity);<br>
      #else<br>
      CkConfig config;<br>
      #endif<br>
      <br>
      CkInit(&amp;config);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java: <code> import com.crickettechnology.audio.*;<br>
      <br>
      // then, in your initialization code:<br>
      Config config = new Config();<br>
      Ck.init(this, config);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Objective-C: <code> #import "ck/objc/ck.h"<br>
      #import "ck/objc/config.h"<br>
      <br>
      // then, in your initialization code:<br>
      CkConfig config;<br>
      CkConfigInit(&amp;config); // set to defaults<br>
      <br>
      CkInit(&amp;config);<br>
    </code> <br>
    <br>
    The <span class="filename">CkConfig</span> class contains some
    initialization options; for example, you can specify a custom memory
    allocator.&nbsp; They can be left at their defaults or set according to your
    needs.<br>
    <br>
    In the C++ code, note that on Android you must pass a&nbsp;<span class="filename">JNIEnv</span>
    pointer and a&nbsp;<span class="filename">jobject</span> reference to your
    activity.&nbsp; If you are initializing Cricket Audio from a JNI function
    call from a Java activity, the&nbsp;<span class="filename">JNIEnv*</span>
    and&nbsp;<span class="filename">jobject</span> are passed as the first and
    second arguments to your native JNI function.&nbsp; If you are initializing
    Cricket Audio from a native activity, they can be found in the&nbsp;<span class="filename">env</span>
    and&nbsp;<span class="filename">clazz</span> members of the&nbsp;<span class="filename">ANativeActivity</span>
    struct.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="updating"></a>
    <h2>Updating</h2>
    Once per frame, you should update Cricket Audio:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code>CkUpdate();</code> <br>
    Java: <code>Ck.update();</code> <br>
    Objective-C: <code>CkUpdate();</code> <br>
    (If you are not using a frame-based rendering API like OpenGL, then just
    make sure you update Cricket Audio from the main thread every 30 ms or so.)<br>
    <a name="playing_bank_sounds"></a>
    <h2>Playing bank sounds</h2>
    First, load your bank; then create your sound from the bank, and play it.<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> CkBank* bank = CkBank::newBank("my_bank.ckb");<br>
      CkSound* sound = CkSound::newBankSound(bank, "my_sound");<br>
      sound-&gt;play();<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java:<code> Bank bank = Bank.newBank("my_bank.ckb");<br>
      Sound sound = Sound.newBankSound(bank, "my_sound");<br>
      sound.play();<br>
    </code> <br>
    Objective-C:<code> CkoBank* bank = [CkoBank newBank:@"my_bank.ckb"];<br>
      CkoSound* sound = [CkoSound newBankSound:bank name:"my_sound"];<br>
      [sound play];<br>
    </code> <br>
    By default, paths refer to an asset embedded in your .apk (that is, one that
    was put in the assets folder of your project) on Android; on iOS, paths are
    relative to the Resources directory of your application.&nbsp; On either
    platform, if you want to load a file from somewhere else (for example, on
    external storage), you can pass in a&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkPathType</span>
    value that indicates how the path is to be interpreted.&nbsp; For example,
    to load a bank using a full path to a file on the file system:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> CkBank* bank = CkBank::newBank("/full/path/to/the/bank.ckb",
      kCkPathType_FileSystem);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java:<br>
    <code> Bank bank = Bank.newBank("/full/path/to/the/bank.ckb",
      PathType.FileSystem);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Objective-C: <code> CkoBank* bank = [CkoBank
      newBank:@"/full/path/to/the/bank.ckb" pathType:kCkPathType_FileSystem];<br>
    </code> <br>
    <br>
    Banks can also be loaded asynchronously using the <span class="filename">newBankAsync()</span>
    function.&nbsp; This will return immediately, and the bank will load in a
    separate thread.&nbsp; You should wait until&nbsp;<span class="filename">isLoaded()</span>
    returns true before calling any other functions on the bank.<br>
    <br>
    If the bank cannot be loaded, the returned <span class="filename">CkBank*</span>
    pointer will be null, or&nbsp;<span class="filename">isFailed()</span> will
    return true.&nbsp; If the sound cannot be created, the returned <span class="filename">CkSound</span>
    pointer will be null.<br>
    <br>
    When you are finished with your sound, destroy the sound; when you are
    finished with a bank, destroy the bank.<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> sound-&gt;destroy();<br>
      bank-&gt;destroy();<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java: <code> sound.destroy();<br>
      bank.destroy();<br>
    </code> <br>
    Objective-C: <code> [sound release];<br>
      [bank release];<br>
    </code> <br>
    Do not call any functions on the sound or bank after destroying them.<br>
    <br>
    In Java, the&nbsp;<span class="filename">destroy()</span> function releases
    the native resources used by the object.&nbsp; If you do not call&nbsp;<span
      class="filename">destroy()</span>, the native resources will be released
    when the object is garbage collected by the JVM.&nbsp; However, it is much
    better to call&nbsp;<span class="filename">destroy()</span> and release them
    explicitly, so you know exactly when it will happen.<br>
    <br>
    In Objective-C, rather than destroying the object explicitly, send the <span
      class="filename">release</span> message; the object will be destroyed when
    the reference count reaches 0.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="playing_stream_sounds"></a>
    <h2>Playing stream sounds</h2>
    First, create your sounds:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> CkSound* sound = CkSound::newStreamSound("my_stream.mp3");<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java: <code> Sound sound = Sound.newStreamSound("my_stream.mp3"); </code>
    <br>
    Objective-C: <code> CkoSound* sound = [CkoSound
      newStreamSound:@"my_stream.mp3];<br>
    </code> <br>
    Unlike a bank sound, a stream sound may not be ready to play immediately, as
    it has to load the initial buffers of audio from a file or from the
    network.&nbsp; If you call&nbsp;<span class="filename">play()</span>
    before&nbsp;<span class="filename">isReady()</span> returns true, there will
    be a slight delay before the sound actually starts playing. <br>
    <br>
    When you are finished with the sound, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">destroy()</span>
    (or <span class="filename">release</span>, in Objective-C).<br>
    <br>
    <a name="using_mixers"></a>
    <h2>Using mixers</h2>
    All sounds are part of a mixer hierarchy, which has a tree structure.&nbsp;
    By default, there is one master mixer, and all sounds are children of that
    master mixer.&nbsp; So, to lower the volume on one sound, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">setVolume()</span>
    on that sound; but if you want to lower the volume on all sounds at once,
    call&nbsp;<span class="filename">setVolume()</span> on the master mixer:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code> CkMixer* master = CkMixer::getMaster();<br>
      master-&gt;setVolume(0.1f);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Java: <code> Mixer master = Mixer.getMaster();<br>
      master.setVolume(0.1f);<br>
    </code> <br>
    Objective-C: <code> CkoMixer* master = CkoMixer.master;<br>
      master.volume = 0.1f;<br>
    </code> <br>
    To create another mixer, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">Mixer::newMixer()</span>.&nbsp;
By
    default, the new mixer is a child of the master mixer; to set its parent to
    a different mixer, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">setParent()</span>.<br>
    <br>
    By default, newly created sounds are assigned to the master mixer.&nbsp; To
    assign a sound to a different mixer, call&nbsp;<span class="filename">Sound::setMixer()</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    When calculating the final mixed volume for a sound, the sound's volume is
    multiplied by the volume of its mixer and of all its mixer's parents.&nbsp;
    For example, this diagram shows sounds 1 and 2 assigned to a mixer that is
    parented to the master mixer, and sound 3 assigned to the master mixer
    itself. If the master mixer volume is 0.8, the child mixer volume is 0.5,
    and the sound volumes are all 0.9, then sounds 1 and 2 will have final mixed
    volumes of 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.36, and sound 3 will have a final mix volume
    of 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72.&nbsp; By adjusting the volume of the child mixer, you
    can adjust the volumes of sounds 1 and 2 simultaneously; by adjusting the
    volume of the master mixer, you can adjust the volumes of all the sounds.<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="mixers" src="images/mixers.svg"><br>
    <br>
    For example, in a game, when a character says a line of dialog, you may want
    the volume of other sounds to decrease, so the dialog is more clearly
    audible.&nbsp; To do this, parent all dialog sounds to one mixer, and parent
    all other game sounds to another mixer.&nbsp; To duck the volume of the game
    sounds, just call&nbsp;<span class="filename">setVolume()</span> on their
    parent mixer.<br>
    <br>
    Mixers can also be paused.&nbsp; Pausing a mixer pauses all its sounds and
    all sounds of descendant mixers.&nbsp; The actual pause state of a sound is
    the logical OR of the pause state of the sound, its mixer, and any ancestor
    mixers.<br>
    <br>
    Pausing mixers can be useful to pause in-game sound effects separately from
    other sound effects.&nbsp; For example, in the diagram above, assume that
    sound 1 and sound 2 are in-game sound effects, but sound 3 is a sound effect
    for a button press.&nbsp; When the user pauses the game, you can pause the
    child mixer, and the in-game sound effects will be paused, but the button
    press sound will not be paused, so it can be played if the user presses some
    buttons on the pause screen.&nbsp; When the user unpauses the game, you just
    need to unpause the child mixer.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="effects"></a>
    <h2>Effects</h2>
    You can also apply real-time audio effects, which can be adjusted
    dynamically.&nbsp; For example, when a character in a game goes underwater,
    you can apply a low-pass filter to some of the sounds to make them sound
    muffled.<br>
    <br>
    To apply effects to your audio, you create one or more effects and add them
    to an effect bus, and then direct a sound's output to that bus:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code>CkEffect* effect =
      CkEffect::newEffect(kCkEffectType_BitCrusher);<br>
      CkEffectBus* bus = CkEffectBus::newEffectBus();<br>
      bus-&gt;addEffect(effect)<br>
      sound-&gt;setEffectBus(bus);</code> <br>
    Java: <code>Effect effect = Effect.newEffect(EffectType.BitCrusher);<br>
      EffectBus bus = EffectBus.newEffectBus();<br>
      bus.addEffect(effect)<br>
      sound.setEffectBus(bus);</code><br>
    Objective-C: <code>CkoEffect* effect = [CkoEffect
      newEffect:kCkEffectType_BitCrusher];<br>
      CkoEffectBus* bus = [CkoEffectBus newEffectBus];<br>
      [bus addEffect:effect];<br>
      sound.effectBus = bus;</code><br>
    Effects will typically have several parameters, which can be adjusted while
    the effects are in use:<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code>effect-&gt;setParam(kCkBitCrusherParam_HoldMs, 1.2f);<br>
    </code><br>
    Java: <code>effect.setParam(BitCrusherParam.HOLD_MS, 1.2f);</code><br>
    Objective-C: <code>[effect setParam:kCkBitCrusherParam_HoldMs value:1.2f];</code><br>
    The output of one or more effect buses can be directed to another effect bus
    using <span class="filename">CkEffectBus::setOutputBus()</span>.&nbsp; So,
    for example, all game dialog sounds could be directed to one effect bus with
    a Biquad Filter effect, and then the output of that bus could be mixed with
    all the gunshot sounds and directed to another bus with a Bit Crusher
    effect:<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="images/effects.svg"><br>
    <br>
    In this diagram, the dialog sounds on the far left will have both the Biquad
    Filter and the Bit Crusher effects applied to them; the sound in the middle
    will have only the Bit Crusher effect applied; and the sound on the right
    which feeds into the global effect bus will have no effects.<br>
    <br>
    You can access that global effect bus, through which all audio is directed
    before output, with <span class="filename">CkEffectBus::getGlobalEffectBus()</span>;
    any effects added there will be applied to all sounds.<br>
    <br>
    You can also (in C++ only) create custom audio effects.&nbsp; Define a class
    derived from <span class="filename">CkEffectProcessor</span>, and register
    a factory function that creates an instance of it with <span class="filename">CkEffect::registerCustomEffect</span>;
    then use <span class="filename">CkEffect::newCustomEffect()</span> to
    create the new effect.&nbsp; For an example, see the "stutter" effect in the
    <a href="examples.html#dsptouch">DspTouch example</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="suspending_and_resuming"></a>
    <h2>Suspending and resuming</h2>
    When your app becomes inactive, suspend Cricket Audio.&nbsp; This pauses
    playback of all sounds and suspends the audio thread.<br>
    <br>
    C++: <code>CkSuspend();</code><br>
    Java: <code>Ck.suspend();</code><br>
    Objective-C: <code>CkSuspend();</code><br>
    <br>
    When you app becomes active again, resume Cricket Audio:<br>
    <br>

    <h2>Threading issues</h2>
    All calls to the Cricket Audio API should be made from the same
    thread.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    If you have provided a custom log function or custom memory
    allocation/deallocation functions in&nbsp;<span class="filename">CkConfig</span>,
    calls to those functions will be made from multiple threads, so they should
    be written to be thread-safe.<br>
